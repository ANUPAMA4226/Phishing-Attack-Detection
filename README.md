# Phishing-Attack-Detection
This Python-based phishing URL detector classifies URLs as legitimate or phishing by analyzing features like URL length, HTTPS, suspicious keywords, domain structure, and SSL certificate validity. A machine learning model processes these features to make predictions, with a simple Tkinter interface for user input and results display.
